Packaging for Open Source Tripwire is maintained by various third parties:

 * RPM: http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/tripwire.git/

 * Debian: https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/tripwire

 * Gentoo: https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/tripwire

 * FreeBSD Ports: http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/tripwire/

 * FreshPorts (BSD): http://www.freshports.org/security/tripwire

 * NetBSD pkgsrc: http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/security/tripwire/README.html
   NOTE: At present (March 2016), NetBSD provides the ancient Tripwire 1.2, from the mid-1990s.
         That version lacks contemporary hash algorithms, and you probably don't want to use it.
