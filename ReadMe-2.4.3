What's new in Open Source Tripwire 2.4.3.0:

* This update fixes compilation errors on modern compilers (GCC 4.7+ and LLVM/clang), 
as well as some additional errors encountered on various platforms.  This is intended
to supersede patches against 2.4.2.x, e.g. http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/tripwire.html
and the additional changes in the FreeBSD ports tree: http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/security/tripwire/

* This update also fixes handling of SHA hashes, which appears to have broken when 
someone added support for using OpenSSL's hash algorithms vs. the ones in the OST tree.
This resulted in SHA hashes always being reported as 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'.  This is 
now fixed for both with- and without-OpenSSL builds.

* The 2.4.3 tree no longer contains an RPM spec file. Instead, the 'Packaging' file
points at where current RPM, Debian, & other package configs can be obtained.

* The 'touchconfig.sh' script bumps file timestamps to prevent spurious make errors
(usually about a missing aclocal-1.8) on a fresh clone/untar/etc., which occur due
to all files in the tree initially having the same timestamps. The only case where 
an 'autoreconf -i' is actually required is on SkyOS 5, where SIZEOF_LONG_LONG gets 
defined incorrectly otherwise.

Building Notes:

* If cross compiling, a '--disable-openssl' argument must be passed to ./configure,
since its OpenSSL existence check currently uses an AC_TRY_RUN macro.

* The '--enable-static' configure argument is not guaranteed to work on all
platforms, and your mileage may vary. And when it works, it may not be doing
what you expect. For example, even if a program is statically linked with
glibc, the static glibc code may still load shared libraries behind the
scenes, for things like iconv character conversion and nsswitch name lookups.

* Recent Android versions may require additional compiler & linker arguments:  
â€œ-fPIE" in CFLAGS and "-fPIE -pie" in LDFLAGS. It's simplest to add these
to configure.in and run autoreconf -i instead of hand-editing each Makefile 
individually.
